# gator

A multi-user command line tool for aggregating RSS feeds and viewing the posts.

This program requires Postgres to be installed.

The program requires a config file to work properly. This config file should be placed in the root of the user's home directory. The name of the config file should be .gatorconfig.json and it should have the following contents:  
{  
&nbsp; &nbsp; "db_url": "postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/gator?sslmode=disable",  
&nbsp; &nbsp; "current_user_name": ""  
}  

The dB URL should be updated to the Postgres database you created for the program.

The program accepts the following commands:
```
 - register <name>             Creates a new user with name <name> and switches to the new user.
 - login <name>                Switch the current user to <name>.
 - users                       List all users.
 - addfeed <name> <url>        Add a feed with name <name>. The data for the feed will be pulled from URL <url>.
 - feeds                       List all feeds that have been added and which user added the feed.
 - follow <url>                Follow the feed with URL <url>. The feed has to exist in the list of existing feeds.
 - following                   List all the feeds the current user is following.
 - unfollow <url>              Unfollow a feed.
 - browse <n>                  Display the <n> most recent posts from all feeds the user is following. <n> defaults to 2 if no <n> is given.
 - agg <time between requests> Download the posts of the feeds at an interval of <time between requests>.
                                   For instance, a value of 1m will pull feeds once every minute. A value of 1h will pull feeds once every hour.
